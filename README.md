A real-time chat application using React, Node/Express, and socket.io. Built off of the simple-react-full-stack repo by [crsandeep](https://github.com/crsandeep/simple-react-full-stack).

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/1qlee/chatwick.git

# Navigate to directory
cd chatwick

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

In development mode, 2 servers will start: one at port 8080 and another at 3000.
The one at 3000 will be your app (the front-end) and the one at 8080 will be the server (the back-end).
